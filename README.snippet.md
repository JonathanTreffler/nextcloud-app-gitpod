## Try it on Gitpod
[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/[user]/[repository/)

It will automatically spin up and configure a full Nextcloud, MariaDB and PhpMyAdmin server.

### Nextcloud Login:
**Username:** dev

**Password:** t2qQ1C6ktYUv7

### PhpMyAdmin Login:
**Username:** nextcloud

**Password:** wdGq73jQB0p373gLdf6yLRj5

(It is fine to have these static logins, because gitpod has acess control built in and no sensitive data is stored in these dev servers)
